A Python library for generating missing values in complete datasets (i.e. amputation) and exploration of incomplete datasets. 

Check out the `documentation`_!

amputation.ampute
-----------------

The MultivariateAmputation class is an implementation of the multivariate amputation methodology by `Schouten, Lugtig and Vink (2018)`_. It is designed as an sklearn TranformerMixin class to allow for easy integration with pipelines.

Compared to the implementation in ``mice:ampute`` in **R**, ``pymice.amputation.ampute`` has a few extra functionalities:

1. The function's arguments are more intuitive. In this `blog post`_, we provide a mapping.
2. The method allows for custom probability functions, see this `example`_.
3. The function allows for non-numerical data features, as long as they are not used as observed data in MAR amputation.

exploration.md_patterns
----------------------

Extra exploration functions are available to explore incomplete datasets. 

The ``mdPatterns`` class is an implementation of ``mice:md.pattern`` in **R** and gives a quick overview of the missingness patterns::

.. code-block:: python

   from pymice.exploration.mdpattern import mdPatterns
   my_pat = mdPatterns(inc_data)
   my_pat.summary()
   my_pat.visualization()
