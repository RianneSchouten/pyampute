pyampute.exploration
====================

In the ``pyampute.exploration`` folder, we provide functionality for inspecting incomplete datasets. 

:class:`~pyampute.exploration.md_patterns.mdPatterns` displays all unique missing data patterns in an incomplete dataset, which is useful for investigating whether there is structure (or a good explanation) for the occurrence of missing data. 

:class:`~pyampute.exploration.mcar_statistical_tests.MCARTest` performs a statistical hypothesis test to evaluate whether it is likely that missing data has a Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanism.
