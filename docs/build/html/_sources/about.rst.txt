Python package ``pyampute`` is developed by Rianne Schouten, Davina Zamanzadeh and Prabhant Singh.

Rianne Schouten
---------------

Rianne is a PhD student in the Data Mining Group at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. Her research focuses on local pattern mining (Exceptional Model Mining), under supervision of `dr. Wouter Duivesteijn`_ and `prof. Mykola Pechenizkiy`_. 

She developed a `multivariate amputation procedure`_ while working at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, under supervision of `dr. Gerko Vink`_ and `prof. Stef van Buuren`_. Rianne is the developer of R-function `ampute`_ in the famous multiple imputation package `mice`_.

Plans for the future include the further development of the two amputation packages, extension of the amputation procedure to time-dependent data (such as longitudinal data) and research on proper evaluation methods for missing data methods in prediction models. 

Rianne's contact details can be found `on her website`_. Questions and comments about ``pyampute`` may also be directed to `r.m.schouten@tue.nl`_.
