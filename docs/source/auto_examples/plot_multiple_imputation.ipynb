        "\n# Single versus multiple imputation\n\nBy default, the IterativeImputer performs single imputation: a method where\nevery missing value is replaced with one imputed value. The chained character\nof the method and the possiblity to draw imputation values from the posterior\ndistribution of a Bayesian imputation model allows for the finding of unbiased\nstatistical estimates. However, the disadvantage is that every imputed value is\ntreated as if the value was observed, leading to an imputed dataset that does\nnot reflect the uncertainty that occurs due to the presence of missing values.\nThis makes it hard to find valid statistical inferences because the variance\n(and standard error) of statistical estimates become too small.\n\nAn alternative is using the IterativeImputer to perform multiple imputation: a\nmethod where every missing value is imputed multiple times. The procedure\nresults in multiple datasets where the observed data is similar in every\ndataset, but the imputed data is different. All desired steps after imputation\nare performed on every dataset, such as standardization and other feature\nengineering steps. The estimation model is also fitted on each of the datasets.\n\nOne final model is obtained by combining the estimates of each model with\nRubin's pooling rules. These rules assume that the parameters of interest are\nnormally distributed which is the case with, for example, estimates of the mean\nand regression coefficients. Other parameters, such as correlation\ncoefficients need transformation to suit the assumption of normality.\nIf it is not possible to approximate a normal distribution, it is better to use\nrobust summary measures such as medians or ranges instead of using Rubin\u2019s\npooling rules. This applies to an estimate like explained variance.\n\nIn sum, Rubin\u2019s pooling rules are as follows. The overall point estimate after\nmultiple imputation (denoted by Qbar) is the average of all the m point\nestimates. The variance of the overall point estimate is a combination of\nso-called within imputation variance (Ubar) and between imputation\nvariance (B). Ubar is the average of the m variances of the m point estimates.\nBoth Qbar and Ubar are corrected with a factor 1 / m to account for sampling\nvariance. The between imputation variance (B) is the sum of the squared\ndifference between Qbar and the m point estimates, corrected with a factor\n1 / (m \u2013 1). Then, the total variance (T) of the MI overall point estimate is\nUbar + B + B/m.\n\nIn this document we will show how to use the IterativeImputer to perform\nmultiple imputation. In example 1 we show the effect of Rubin\u2019s pooling\nrules on the variance of regression estimates. Due to the between imputation\nvariance, the standard errors of all regression coefficients are larger with\nmultiple imputation than with single imputation. This allows for valid\nstatistical inference making.\n\nIn example 2 we show how to set up a prediction model using multiple\nimputation. We compare two approaches. In one approach, we make predictions for\neach of the m datasets and combine the m evaluation error metrics into one\noverall value. In the other approach, we combine the predictions and calculate\none evaluation error metric over the averaged predictions. A short simulation\nstudy shows that the second approach results in the smallest Mean Squared\nError.\n"
