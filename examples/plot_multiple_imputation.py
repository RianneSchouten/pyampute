Imputing missing values using multiple imputation
=================================================

By default, the IterativeImputer performs single imputation: a method where
every missing value is replaced with one imputed value. The chained character
of the method and the possiblity to draw imputation values from the posterior
distribution of a Bayesian imputation model allows for the finding of unbiased
statistical estimates. However, the disadvantage is that every imputed value is
treated as if the value was observed, leading to an imputed dataset that does
not reflect the uncertainty that occurs due to the presence of missing values.
This makes it hard to find valid statistical inferences because the variance
(and standard error) of statistical estimates become too small.

An alternative is using the IterativeImputer to perform multiple imputation: a
method where every missing value is imputed multiple times. The procedure
results in multiple datasets where the observed data is similar in every
dataset, but the imputed data is different. All desired steps after imputation
are performed on every dataset, such as standardization and other feature
engineering steps. The estimation model is also fitted on each of the datasets.

One final model is obtained by combining the estimates of each model with
Rubin's pooling rules. These rules assume that the parameters of interest are
normally distributed which is the case with, for example, estimates of the mean
and regression coefficients. Other parameters, such as correlation
coefficients need transformation to suit the assumption of normality.
If it is not possible to approximate a normal distribution, it is better to use
robust summary measures such as medians or ranges instead of using Rubin’s
pooling rules. This applies to an estimate like explained variance.

In sum, Rubin’s pooling rules are as follows. The overall point estimate after
multiple imputation (denoted by Qbar) is the average of all the m point
estimates. The variance of the overall point estimate is a combination of
so-called within imputation variance (Ubar) and between imputation
variance (B). Ubar is the average of the m variances of the m point estimates.
Both Qbar and Ubar are corrected with a factor 1 / m to account for sampling
variance. The between imputation variance (B) is the sum of the squared
difference between Qbar and the m point estimates, corrected with a factor
1 / (m – 1). Then, the total variance (T) of the MI overall point estimate is
Ubar + B + B/m.

In this document we will show how to use the IterativeImputer to perform
multiple imputation. In example 1 we show the effect of Rubin’s pooling
rules on the variance of regression estimates. Due to the between imputation
variance, the standard errors of all regression coefficients are larger with
multiple imputation than with single imputation. This allows for valid
statistical inference making.

In example 2 we show how to set up a prediction model using multiple
imputation. We compare two approaches. In one approach, we make predictions for
each of the m datasets and combine the m evaluation error metrics into one
overall value. In the other approach, we combine the predictions and calculate
one evaluation error metric over the averaged predictions. A short simulation
study shows that the second approach results in the smallest Mean Squared
Error.
